# Demo programs for courses taught at the University of South-eastern Norway

Small applications written to illustrate pheniomena thought in courses, either for demonstrations n the classroom, or for use by  students on their own.
The programs are written in Matlab, NI LabVIEW, or JupytherLab for the courses 'TSE2280 Measurement Technology and Signal Processing' and 'SPE590 Specialisation Topic (Acoustics and Ultrasound Technology)'

## TSE2280 Measurement Technology and Signal Processing
- Step response of a first-order dynamic system (Matlab-app) `first_order_step_resp.mlapp`
- Step response of a second-order dynamic system (Matlab-app) `second_order_step_resp.mlapp`
- Illustration of sine- and cosine-functions as complex phasors (Matlab-app) `phasor_demo.mlapp`
- Illustration of arbitrary signals being constructed from sine-waves, i.e. Fourier coefficients (Matlab-app) `fouriersynthesis.mlapp`

## SPE590 Specialisation Topic (Acoustics and Ultrasound Technology)
