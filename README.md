# Demo Programs for Courses at the University of South-eastern Norway

Small applications written to illustrate pheniomena thought in courses, either for demonstrations n the classroom, or for use by  students on their own.
The programs are written in Matlab, NI LabVIEW, or JupytherLab for the courses 'TSE2280 Measurement Technology and Signal Processing' and 'SPE590 Specialisation Topic (Acoustics and Ultrasound Technology)'

## TSE2280 Measurement Technology and Signal Processing

### Dynamic Systems
- Step response of a first-order dynamic system (Matlab-app) `first_order_step_resp.mlapp`
- Step response of a second-order dynamic system (Matlab-app) `second_order_step_resp.mlapp`

### Signals
- Illustration of sine- and cosine-functions as complex phasors (Matlab-app) `phasor_demo.mlapp`
- Convolution (Matlab-app) `convolution_demo.mlapp`
- Illustration of arbitrary signals being constructed from sine-waves, i.e. Fourier coefficients (Matlab-app) `fouriersynthesis.mlapp`

### Filters
- Frequency response of FIR-filter (Matlab-app) `fir_frequency.mlapp`
- Simple bandpass FIR-filter `fir_simple_bandpass.mlapp` 
- Response of IIR-filter (Matlab-app) `iir_filter.mlapp`
- Response of IIR-filter (Matlab-function) `iir_response.m`
- Running-average FIR-filter `running_average_example.mlapp`
- Illustration of the Dirichle-kernel (MAtlab-app) `dirichletkernel.mlapp`
- 3D illustration of pole-zero plot in the z-plane (MAtlab-function) `pole_zero_3d.m`
  
### Support Functions
- Scale x- and y-axes in units of \pi `pi_scaled_axis.m`
