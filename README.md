# Demo Programs for Courses at the University of South-Eastern Norway

## Ultrasound and Signal Processing

This repository contains small applications written to illustrate phenomena taught in courses, either for classroom demonstration or for use by students on their own. 
The programs were written over several years using different tools, to the courses presently called  'TSE2280 Measurement Technology and Signal Processing' and 'SPE590 Specialisation Topic (Acoustics and Ultrasound Technology)'.

The LabVIEW and Matlab programs will need access to all files in their folders to function.
The Matlab functions (.m) are called from the Matlab console or from antoher Matlab-function.
The LabVIEW VIs (.vi) and Matlab-apps (.mlapp) are stand-alone programs with a graphical user interface.
The JupyterLab .ipynb-files can be run interactively in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
