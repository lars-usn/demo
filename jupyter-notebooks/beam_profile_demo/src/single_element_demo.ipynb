    "Evaluation of the Rayleigh integral for an arbitrary vibrating surface is complicated and can in general only be done numerically. However, approximate solutions can be found for some common aperture shapes in the far-field, i.e., at large distance from the source. The far-field approximations are also valid in the focal region of focused transducers. \n",

    "1. **Amplitude.** The variations in the amplitude factor $\\frac{1}{2\\pi R}$ are small when $R$ varies over the aperture $S_1=(x_1,y_1)$. These variations are ignored by setting $\\frac{1}{2\\pi R} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase.** The phase factor $e^{-j\\omega R/c}$  causes interference between waves from different positions on the aperture. These differences in $R$ need not be small compared to the wavelength $\\lambda$ , and are included to the first order by the approximation. The distance $R$ from the source point $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ to the field point $(x,y,z)$ can under this assumption be approximated to\n",

    "Note that $D(\\theta,\\phi)$ is the 2D spatial Fourier-transformation of the apodization function $\\xi(x_1,y_1)$. This allows fast and easy numerical calculations by using the FFT-function built into most software tools. \n",

Two important examples are rectangular and circular apertures with uniform oscillation amplitude, i.e. $\\xi(x_1,y_1)=1$ inside the aperture $S_1$ and $\\xi(x_1,y_1)=0$ outside $S_1$. See the lecture notes for details on how the calculations are evaluated.\n",

An estimate of the minimum distance where this is valid is the *Rayleigh distance* $z_R$. This is the point on the acoustic axis where the distance $R$ to all points on the transducer aperture vary less than a quarter wavelength, i.e., the distance where $R_{max} - z_R = \\tfrac14 \\lambda$, where $R_{max}$ is the distance to the furthest point on the aperture. The situation is illustrated in the figure below for a circular transducer with diameter $d$.\n",
