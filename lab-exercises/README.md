# Lab Exercises for _DSP First_ modified and converted to Python
## Lab exercises for the USN-course _TSE2280 MÃ¥leteknikk og signalbehandling_ (_Measurement Technology and Signal Processsing_)

The course uses the textbook McClellan et al., "DSP First", 2nd ed., Pearson Education Limited, 2016.

These labs are based on the exercises supplied with the textbook, see https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/. 
The original lab exercises in Matlab have been converted to Python and modified to fit better to this course.
New interactive demo-programs have been written for JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, these are found under the `JupyterLab` folder

This is work in progress. These lab exercises and corresponding demo programs are run for the first time in the spring semester of 2025. New files will be added and the existing ones will be updated with new version based on experences from the course.
