\section{Introduction}
\suppressfloats[t]
This lab is a modified version of the lab \emph{Lab P-3: Introduction to Complex Exponentials – Direction Finding}\cite{mcclellan_lab_2016} that accompanies the text-book. The original lab has been converted from Matlab to Python and some of exercises have been changed. 

The lab demonstrates concepts from Chapters 2 and 3 in the course text-book \emph{Signal Processing First} by McClellan et~al \cite{mcclellan_dsp_2016}. The intewntion is to give a better understanding of sinusoidal signals how they are described by complex amplitude vectors, \emph{phasors}.

The exercise was made for the course \emph{TSE2280 - Measurements and Signal Processing} taught at the University of South-Eastern Norway.

\subsection{Aim}
The first part of this lab gives training in using Python with complex exponentials to create and manipulate sinusoidal  signals. The last part uses  this to estimate the direction of a sound source by using the phase difference between signals received by two microphones. 
This type of direction estimates is the basis for steering and focusing ultrasound beams with \emph{phased arrays} in sonar and medical ultrasound. It is also used to steer radar beams and in wifi and 5G antennas.

This lab is a computer simulation only. You can quite easily test it on a real situation. Record a sound with two microphones using the stereo channels in your sound card, and then test the method on the recorded signal.


\subsection{Software Tools: Python with Spyder and Jupyter Lab}
The programs for the lab shall be written in Python using the libraries \emph{Numpy} for representing signals and \emph{Matplotlib} for plotting graphs. Later exercises will use the signal processing library in \emph{Scipy} (\emph{scipy.signal}) but Scipy is not needed in this exercise.

You may also load Python's mathematics library for complex numbers \emph{cmath}, but be aware that this handle scalar numbers only. The signals are more conveniently represented by arrays as in Numpy.
The recommended setup of libraries for this exerceie is shown in \tableref{import-libraries}

The recommended Python programming environment for this and the following labs is \emph{Spyder}\cite{raybaut_spyder_2024}, which is included in the \emph{Anaconda}\cite{noauthor_anaconda_2024} package management. However, any Python package management and programming environment should function.

All code files shall be included with the lab report. We recommend collecting everything, i.e.~code, text and figures, into a single \emph{Jupyter Notebook}\cite{project_jupyter_jupyter_nodate}, but a pdf with separate Python files is also acceptable.


\begin{table}[t!]
\caption{Recommended format for importing the Python libraries used in this exercise. \emph{Numpy} is used to manipulate signals and time-vectors as arrays. \emph{Matplotlib}'s \emph{pyplot} is used to plot the results in graphs.
	The complex math library \emph{cmath} is included to have more direct access the mathematical constants and functions, in this case $\pi$ and the complex exponential \texttt{exp}. This is strictly not necessary as these are also included in Numpy. Note that the \emph{cmath} functions can handle scalars only, not arrays. }

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Sinusoidial Signals and Phasors}
The aim of the first part of this lab is to obtain experience with complex numbers, and using phasors and complex exponentials to represent sinusoidial signals.

Recall from the lectures that a sinusoidal signal $x(t)$ is written as 
\begin{align}
	x(t)&= A cos(\omega t + \phi) = \Re\left\{ A e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} \right\} 
		=  \Re\left\{ X e^{j\omega t} \right\} \quad , &
	X &= A e^{j\phi} 
\end{align}
where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, $f$ is the frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase. $	X = A e^{j\phi} $ is a \emph{phasor} or \emph{complex amplitude} that includes both the amplitude and the phase of the signal.
Analysis of sinusoidal signals like $x(t)$ is in general simpler by manipulating phasors instead of using the amplitude and phase separately.

\subsection{Complex Numbers in Python with Numpy}
Analysis of complex quantities in Python is simple. When using the library \emph{Numpy}, complex numbers are handled almost exactly as real numbers, i.e.~most of the usual mathematical operators and functions can be used on complex numbers.

\tableref{complex-overview} lists the basic operations in complex numbers in Python using \emph{Numpy}. Note that all function calls in this table are prefixed by \texttt{np} due to the way \emph{Numpy }was imported, see \tableref{import-libraries}. Note also that a complex number in Python has three public members, \texttt{real}, \texttt{imag}, and \texttt{conjugate()}

\begin{table}[t!]
	\caption{Overview of basic complex number operations in Python. Detailed explanations and more functions are found in the documentation for Numpy.

\subsection{Adding Sinusiods using Complex Exponentials}
Sinusoidal signals are most conveniently handled using complex exponentials. The theory behind this is given in Chapter 2 in the textbook and was presented in the lectures. It is briefly summarised here.

Look at a signal that is the sum of sinusoids that all have the same $f_0$, while the amplitude $A_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ of the individual signals can be different, 
\begin{align}
	x_s(t)= \sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \cos(2\pi f_0 t + \phi_k)   \:.
\end{align}
The resulting summed signal can be found by summing the complex exponentials and then taking the real part. This is called \emph{phasor summation} and is  easier than using trigonometric identities, 
\begin{align}
	x_s(t)= \Re\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}  A_k e^{j\phi_k} e^{j2\pi f_0 t } \right\}  
			= \Re\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}  X_k  e^{j2\pi f_0 t } \right\}  \:.
	\label{eq:phasorsum}
\end{align}
The \emph{complex amplitude }or \emph{phasor} $X_k$ is defined as 
\begin{align}
	X_k &= A_k e^{j\phi_k} \:.
\end{align}
The factor $ e^{j2\pi f_0 t}$ in \Eq{phasorsum} is equal for all the individual signals, i.e., independent of $k$, so the amplitude $A_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ of the summed signal $x_s(t)$ can be found by summing the complex amplitudes, 
\begin{align}
	x_s(t)&= \Re \left\{ X_s e^{j\omega t } \right\} = A_s \cos(2\pi f_0 t + \phi_s)  \:,
	 &  X_s&= \sum_{k=1}^{N} X_k = A_s e^{j\phi_k}  \:.
\end{align}
The resulting signal will have the same frequency $f_0$ and period $T_0=1/f_0$ as the original signals. 

\subsection{Harmonics and Periodic signals}
Consider now a signal $x_h(t)$ where the frequencies $f_k$ of the individual cosine-waves are different, but are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency $f_0$, 
\begin{align}
	f_k& = k f_0 \quad , & k&= 0,1,2, \ldots \:.
\end{align}
The individual signals $\cos(2\pi k f_0 t +\phi_k)$ are called \emph{harmonics} and the summed signal $x_h(t)$ can be written as
\begin{align}
	x_h(t)= \sum_{k=1}^{N}  A_k \cos(2\pi k f_0 t +j\phi_k)
		= \Re\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}  X_k  e^{j2\pi k f_0 t } \right\}  \:.
		\label{eq:harmonicsum}
\end{align}
The periods $T_k$ of the individual waves are 
\begin{align}
	T_k &= T_0/k
\end{align}
After the period $T_0=k T_k$ of the fundamental frequency, the individual signals have repeated themselves $k$. Hence, all he frequency components will also be periodic with period $T_0$, and the resulting signal $x_h(t)$ will be periodic with period given by the fundamental frequency $f_0$ as $T_0=1/f_0$.

Note that \emph{phasor addition} \emph{cannot} be used on this case, it can only be applied to signals where \emph{all frequency components are equal}.

\section{Programming Tips}

\subsection{Complex Numbers and Phasors}
The Python file \verb|zplot.py| contains functions to plot complex numbers as phasors, add them, and show the resulting phasor plots and sinusoids. The functions are listed in \tableref{zplot}

\begin{table}
	\caption{Functions to show complex numbers as phasors in the complex plane, called Argand-diagrams. The functions are found in the file \emph{zplot.py} included for this lab. }
	\label{tab:zplot}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
		\\
		Command					& Description		\\
		\hline \\
		\verb|import zplot| & 
		\multicolumn{1}{l}{Import the library to illustrate complex numbers. } \\
		\\
		\verb|zplot.unitcircle()|		& Plot the complex plane with the unit circle. \\ \\
		\verb|zplot.phasor(z_array)|  	& Plot the complex numbers in the \numpy array \verb|z_array| and their sum as phasors. \\ \\
%		\verb|zplot.signal(z_array, frequency)|  	& Plot the phasor diagram with \verb|zplot.phasor| and show the resulting signals as time traces. \verb|frequency | is set to \num{1} if not specified. \\
%		\\
		\hline \\
	\end{tabularx}
	
\end{table}


\subsection{Vectorization}
\emph{Numpy} module allows mathematical operations to be used on arrays. This is convenient when defining signals such as $x(t)=A \cos(2\pi f t + \phi)$. Here, the amplitude $A$ and phase $\phi$ are scalars, while the time $t$ is a vector spanning the time interval to be investigated. 

Vectors spanning e.g., a time interval are created in \emph{numpy} by one of these methods

\subsubsection*{Specifying start, stop and step by the function \texttt{arange}} 
A time vector $t$ will typically be defined as\\
\verb|t = np.arange(t_start, t_end, dt|), \\
where \verb|t_start| is the first point in $t$, \verb|t_end| marks the end of $t$, and \verb|dt| is the interval between the time points. Note that the value \verb|t_end| is not included in the time vector, $t$ will end on the last point before \verb|t_end|.
	
\subsubsection*{Specifying start, stop, and total number of points by the function \texttt{linspace}. }
Using this method, a time vector $t$ will typically be defined as \\
\verb|t = np.linspace(t_start, t_end, n_points)|, \\
where \verb|t_start| is the first point in $t$, \verb|t_end| marks the end of $t$, and \verb|n_points| is number of points in the time vector. Note again that the last value \verb|t_end| is not included in the time vector, $t$ will end on the last point before \verb|t_end|.
	
\subsubsection*{Specifying start, stop, and total number of points by the function \texttt{logspace}.} 
	
This is the same as \verb|linspace|, but the numbers are evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale, and the start and end points are specified by their logarithms: \verb|start=2| means the first value is \num{e2}=\num{100}.


\section{Training Exercises}

\subsection{Python Function to Generate a Sum of Sinosoid Signals}
Many functions will be described as a sum of sinosoids where the frequency components have different amplitudes $A_k$, frequencies $f_k$, and phase $\phi_k$, as described in Equation~\eqref{eq:harmonicsum}.

To handle this situation, it can be convenient to have a function that can generate a signal from several cosine-functions, each specified by its amplitude, frequency and phase.

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
	\item Write a function that generates a signal
	\begin{align*}
		x(t)= \sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \cos(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k) =\sum_{k=1}^{N} X_k e^{j2\pi f_k t}.
	\end{align*}
	The input arguments are the complex amplitude $X_k=A_k e^{j\phi}$, frequency $f_k$, sample rate $f_s$ and the signal duration.
	
	The function shall return the summed signal $x(t)$ and the time vector $t$ where the signal is evaluated.
	
	The frequencies $f_k$ and complex amplitudes $X_k$ shall be specified as Numpy arrays, and the function shall accept any number of frequency components. 
	
	Each frequency $f_k$ shall match a complex amplitude $X_k$, so these vectors must have equal length. The resulting function must check for this and shall return an error message if the lengths are different. 
	
	A skeleton of the function with the recommended function call and header is listed in \tableref{summed_cos}. 
	
	
	\item Demonstrate that your function works by plotting the output for a signal that is the sum of the following components.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ccc}
			\hline
				&	Frequencies	& Complex amplitudes	\\
			k	&	$f_k$ [Hz]		& $X_k$  			\\

		\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Set the sample rate to \qty{10000}{Samples/s}, the duration of the signal to \qty{0.1}{s}, and the start time to \qty{0}{s}. Plot the result with \emph{Matplotlib}.
	
	\item Measure the period $T_0 $ of the signal from the graph. Compare this with the periods $T_k$ of the individual frequency components $f_k$.
	
	Explain how the period of the summed signal can be calculated from the periods of the individual components.
	
	\item Generate the signal
	\begin{align*}
		x(t) &= \Re{-2e^{j50\pi t} - e^{j50\pi(t-0.02)} +(2-3j)e^{j50\pi t}   } 
	\end{align*}
	over a time range that covers 3 periods. 
	
	Plot the signal $x$ a function of time $t$.

\section{Lab Exercise: Direction finding}
The text in this exercise is almost entirely copied from \cite{mcclellan_lab_2016}.

Why do humans have two ears? One answer is that the brain can process acoustic signals received at the two ears and determine the direction to the source of the acoustic energy. Using sinusoids, we can describe and analyze a simple scenario that explains this direction finding capability in terms of phase differences (or time-delay differences). 

This same principle is used in many other applications including radars that locate and track airplanes, and it gives the basis for phased array transducers used in medical ultrasound and sonar.

\subsection{Direction Finding with Microphones}
Consider a simple measurement system that consists of two microphones that can both hear the same source signal. If the microphones are placed some distance apart, then the sound must travel different paths from the source to the receivers. When the travel paths have different lengths, the two signals will arrive at different times. Thus a comparison of the two received signals will allow us to measure the relative time difference (between peaks), and from that we can calculate the direction. If the source signal is a sinusoid, we can measure the travel time differences by measuring phases.

The scenario is illustrated in \Fig{overview} where a vehicle travelling on the roadway has a siren that is transmitting a very loud sinusoidal waveform whose frequency is $f_s$=\qty{400}{Hz}. The roadway forms the $x$-axis of a coordinate system.

The two receivers (microphones) are located some distance away and are aligned parallel to the roadway. The distance from the road is $y_r$=\qty{100}{m}, and the receiver separation is $d$=\qty{0.4}{m}. The signals at the receivers must be processed to find the angle from Receiver (1) to the vehicle, which is denoted as $\theta$ in Fig. 1.

\begin{stdfig}
	\input{../figs/direction-finding-main-illustration.tex}
	\caption{Direction finding using two microphones. A vehicle at position $x_v$ travels along the $x$-axis while emitting a sound with frequency $f_s$=\qty{400}{Hz}. The sound is picked up by two microphones M1 and M2 positioned with spacing $d$=\qty{0.40}{m}. The difference in propagation distance $\Delta s= s_1-s_2$ causes a phase-shift between the signals received by the two microphones. This phase shift can be used to estimate the direction to the vehicle emitting the sound, specified by the angle $\theta$. }
	\label{fig:overview}
\end{stdfig}

\begin{stdfig}
	\input{../figs/direction-finding-approximation.tex}
	\caption{Zoomed-in version of \Fig{overview} to show the difference in propagation distance $\Delta s$ from the sound source to the two  microphones. When the distance to the source is very long compared to the distance between the microphones,$s_1, s_2 \ll d$, the paths can be approximated as parallel and the difference in distance is 
		$\Delta s = s_1 - s_2 \approx d sin \theta$
		where $\theta$ is the direction to the source. }
	\label{fig:far_field_zoom}
\end{stdfig}


\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The delay from the sound is transmitted by the source to it is received by the microphone can be computed for both propagation paths. First , consider Path (1) from the vehicle to Receiver (1). The time delay is the distance from the vehicle location at coordinate ($x_v$,0) to the
	receiver at coordinate (0,$y_r$), divided by the speed of sound $c$.
	The speed of sound in air can be set to $c$=\qty{340}{m/s}. 
	
	Write a mathematical expression for the time delay as function of the vehicle position $x_v$. 
		Call this delay $t_1$.
		
	\item Write a mathematical formula for the time delay of the signal that travels \emph{path (2)} from the transmitter at coordinate ($x_v$,0) to Receiver (2) at coordinate ($d$, $y_r$).
	
	Call this delay $t_2$ and express it as a function of the vehicle position $x_v$.
	
	\item The received signals at the receivers, $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$,  are delayed copies of the transmitted signal,
	\begin{align*}
		x_1(t)&= s(t-t_1)  &	x_2(t)&= s(t-t_2)  
	\end{align*}
	where $s(t)$ is the transmitted sinusoidal signal.
	
	Assume that the source signal $s(t)$ is a zero-phase sinusoid at $f_0$=\qty{400}{Hz}, and set the amplitude of the transmitted signal to $A_s$=\num{1000}. 
	
	Make a plot of $x_1(t)$ and $x_1(t)$ when the vehichle position $x_v$=\qty{100}{m}.
	
	Use subplots to put both signals on the figure. 
	Plot 3 periods and measure the relative time-shift between the two received
	signals by comparing the peak locations.
	
	\item How do we convert relative time-shift into the direction $\theta$?
	
	The distance from the microphones to the source is often much larger than the distance between the microphones. We can then ignore that the angles from $M1$ and $M2$ are actually slightly different, and assume that the paths are close to parallel, with the same angle $\theta$. This situation is illustrated in \Fig{far_field_zoom}, where we have zoomed in on the microphones in \Fig{overview}. 
	This
	
	The distance in propagation length for the two paths $s_1$ and $s_2$ from the source to the microphones can now be approximated to, see \Fig{far_field_zoom}
	\begin{align}
		\Delta s = s_1-s_2 = d \sin\theta 
	\end{align}
	This is called the \emph{far field approximation} and is often used to find the beam pattern from antennas, loudspeakers, ultrasound trasnducers, and other sources.
	
	The propagation time $t$ along the paths is given as $t=s/c$, giving the time-shift $\Delta t$ between the signals arriving at the two microphones as
	\begin{align}
		\Delta t = t_1-t_2 = \frac{d \sin\theta }{c} \:,
	\end{align}
	which corresponds to a phase-shift $\Delta \phi$ between the two signal of
	\begin{align}
		\Delta \phi = -2\pi \Delta t f_s = -2 \pi \frac{d f_s \sin\theta }{c} 
		= -2 \pi \frac{d \sin\theta }{\lambda_s}\:,
	\end{align}
	where $\lambda_s=c/f_s$ is the wavelength of the emitted sound.
	
	For the relative time-shift obtained in the previous part, calculate $\theta$. In addition, use geometry and the values
	of $x_v$ and $y_r$ to figure out what the “true value” of $\theta$ should be. 
	
	Verify that your calculated value of $\theta$ is very close to the true value.
	
	\item The objective in the rest of this lab is to write a Python function that will process the received signals to find direction. 
	To do this, the received signals will be given as complex amplitudes, and a Python function called
	DF gen is supplied for generating the receiver signals.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=pythonstyle]
	function [X1,X2,theta] = DF_gen(xx)
	%DF_GEN generate complex amplitudes at the two receivers
	% for the Direction Finding Lab
	% usage [X1,X2,theta] = DF_gen;
	%
	% X1 = complex amplitude at Receiver #1
	% X2 = complex amplitude at Receiver #2
	% theta = the TRUE value of the "direction" in DEGREES
	%
	% alternate usage:
	% [X1,X2,theta] = DF_gen(xx);
	%
	% xx = vector of "x positions" of the vehicle
	% then X1, X2 and theta are vectors
	
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	When you have only the complex amplitudes, the relative time-shift cannot be measured directly, so the measurement has to be done with the phases. In other words, the receivers will have complex amplitudes $X_1 = A_1 e^{j\phi_1}$ and $X_2 = A_2 e^{j\phi_2}$. 
	and we must determine the phase difference $\Delta \phi = \phi_1 - \phi_2$.
	The phase difference can then be converted into a time difference according to the well-known relationship between the time-shift and phase-shift for sinusoids.
	
	Show that you can compute the phase difference from $X_1$ and $X_2$ by the following equation
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta \phi = \angle \{ X_1 X_2^* \}
	\end{align*}
	where the superscript * denotes the complex conjugate. Use the ideas in (9) and (10) to write a Python 	function that will compute the direction $\theta$ from the complex amplitudes.
		
	\item Debug the program from the previous part by using the function DF gen to test individual
	cases. Then run your function for the vehicle moving from $x_v$=\qty{-400}{m} meters to \qty{+500}{m} in steps of one meter.
	
	Compare the computed value of $\theta$ to the true value of $\theta$ (given by DF gen) by plotting both on the same graph.
	
	Note that vectorization can make this program simpler and faster than running through all positions in a for-loop. Define all positions $x_v$ as a numpy-array and calculate the delays $\delta t$ and angles $\theta$ directly as arrays.
